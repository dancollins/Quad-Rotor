## Description

This device is actually really basic; it is a gateway between bluetooth and the 433MHz radios I use.  The android sends stuff to the bluetooth, the PIC reads this and puts it onto the radio.  Easy.

In the future, this device will be bidirectional, allowing the display of information on the android app...  In future, the bluetooth will be replaced with USB, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
