The files in this repository are released under the Primis Open Programming Language (POPL), which is available for download at http://primiscomputers.com/POPL.txt.

These files make up the software side of my quad rotor poject, which you see can at: http://dancollins.github.com/projects/quad_rotor.html  The master branch will contain the working source, and the experimental branch will, in the future, contain the latest source.  I do not gaurantee either to be bug free, but you can expect the experimental source to buggy compared to the master at times (other times the experimental might be more stable!).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  My details are at: http://dancollins.github.com/contact.html
