This directory holds the source used to get my quad rotor off the ground.  It is the collection of many hours of work, and is totally experimental!
Any files used to make this work, such as EAGLE design files, will also be included within.  I hope I can come up with an easy to follow directory
structure, but if not send me an email to tell me a better way!

* Sensor Interface
	* Gyroscope
	* Accelerometer
