Quad Rotor Android Control App
========================

This is a (currently) simple app which transmits the posistion of a scroll bar over bluetooth. It was created in eclipse, and this folder includes a bunch of stuff that eclipse probably uses itself.  You'll need to get the Amarino library from http://www.amarino-toolkit.net/index.php/download.html in order to use it...
